The underlying C code for generation of transfer functions and
calculation of formants was written by Dr. Shinji Maeda
(\href{mailto:shinji@tsi.enst.fr}{shinji@tsi.enst.fr}), as part of
a DOS program called VTCALCS.

The Matlab code for synthesis of vowels is part of a package
called Track Draw, developed by Peter Assmann
(\href{mailto:assmann@utdallas.edu}{assmann@utdallas.edu}), and is
