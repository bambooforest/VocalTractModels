\chapter{Known bugs and limitations}

Although the current bugs do not hinder the functionality of the
program directly, they will be removed in the next version. Some
of these bugs, when removed, will add further possibilities to the
program.

The following are the list of bugs as of 18.Oct.1999. Please send
a mail to \href{mailto:satra@cns.bu.edu}{satra@cns.bu.edu} for any
new bugs.
